 * @brief The session struct.
 * The session is used as a context for nodes and triple store.
 * Each session is independent from another sessions.
 * There is default session (@see #g_session_default),
 * this session useful when a KP doesn't use several sessions.
 * All nodes works in the default session if the session
 * explicitly doesn't set to nodes.
