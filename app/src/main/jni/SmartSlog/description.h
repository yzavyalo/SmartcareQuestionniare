 *
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * SmartSlog is a library to implement Knowledge Processors for 
 * the Smart-M3 platform (http://sourceforge.net/projects/smart-m3/).
 * SmartSlog versions 0.6 higher supports double API:
 * <ul>
 * <li>high-level API is based on entities (classes, properties and individuals);</li>
 * <li>low-level API is based on triples and similar
 * with low-level KPIs (Knowledge Processors Interfaces).
 * KPIs examples: C_KPI (SmartSlog is based on it),
 * KPI_LOW (http://sourceforge.net/projects/kpilow),
 * JavaKPI (http://sourceforge.net/projects/smartm3-javakpi).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Versions of SmartSlog under 0.6 support only high-level API and KPs implemented
 * with such versions are not fully compatable with 0.6 and higher versions.
